In NestJS, **scope** refers to the lifecycle and sharing behavior of providers managed by the dependency injection system. Providers can be configured with different scopes, which determine how instances are created and shared.

### Types of Scopes

1. **Default Scope (Singleton)**:
   - The provider is instantiated once for the entire application lifecycle.
   - The same instance is shared across all components that inject it.

2. **Transient Scope**:
   - A new instance of the provider is created every time it is injected.
   - This is useful when each consumer needs its own instance, independent of others.

3. **Request Scope**:
   - A new instance of the provider is created for each incoming HTTP request.
   - All components involved in handling the same request share this instance, ensuring isolation for each request.

### Choosing the Appropriate Scope

- Use **singleton scope** for most services or utilities where a shared, long-lived instance is sufficient.
- Opt for **transient scope** when unique instances are necessary for every injection, such as temporary tasks or dynamic operations.
- Choose **request scope** when you need request-specific instances, such as services that manage request-level data or context.

Scopes allow you to tailor the behavior of providers to suit the specific needs of your application.
